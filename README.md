# flutter-animations

Animation creation project using Flutter

## Requirements

## Implicit Animations

-   Using only implicit animations

## Explicit Animations

-   Using only explicit animations

## Pomodoro Watch

-   The timer's progress bar shall be engineered using a Custom Painter, ensuring its animation corresponds in real-time to the elapsed duration.
-   The application shall feature three primary controls: play/pause, stop, and reset. The visual representation of the timer, as illustrated by the progress bar, must update dynamically based on the state invoked by these controls.

## Flashcards

-   Using a Custom Painter, design a progress bar at the bottom to visually display the user's progress through the flashcards.
-   Gestures should be integrated such that tapping on a flashcard reveals its answer, dragging it to the left turns the app background red, and dragging it to the right turns it green.
-   Upon dismissing a card, the subsequent flashcard should be presented to the user.

## Game Store App

-   Utilize the essence of Flutter animation to implement a game store app. This should involve using the flutter_animate package, implementing the AnimatedSwitcher, and incorporating both horizontal and vertical navigation.
